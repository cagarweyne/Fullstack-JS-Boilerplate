# Fullstack-JS-Boilerplate

This is a fullstack JS Boilerplate code and includes the following: 

1. Full working user registration and authentication feature. Note this is bare minimal, you will have to add form input validation. 

2. MongoDB integrated. MongoDB along with Mongoose is added to write to the DB.

3. Node.js with express.js on the server side

4. React with Redux on the frontend. 

That's really! :)
